# Written Report for the UFOs challenge

## Overview of UFOs  Challenge 

- In this challenge we are working with Dana to create a webpage and dynamic tables that provide an more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filer through multiple criteria.

### Purpose

- Throughout the module we learned to create the bones of the webpage as well as have some filters to parse through the data provided in the data.js file. 
- In this challenge we are tasked to create additional filters, I also took the liberty to add a few small changes to the background images as well.   

## Analysis and Challenges

- In this challenge we first created a JavaScript app.js that contains the functions we needed. 
- We then deployed both the app.js as well as the data source provided from the data.js into and HTML file.
- Finally we built out the HTML file (index.html) with Bootstrap as well as a customized CSS file. 

### Analysis of Outcomes 

- We were successful in creating our webpage, the filters are functional as well.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The main challenge I had was grasping the new langauge, Javascript has much more to do in terms of typing and syntax than python, although it is very familiar to python.
- I am still struggling quiet a bit with HTML as well, however it is getting easier the more I use it.   

## Results
- The web app that was created was functional to the point of the challenge however I did not have enough time to go into much more depth than that throughout the week.
- In the future if/ when I have more time I would like to develop a better web app that looks much better and is more functional than what I presented in this challenge. 
- One of the issues with this web page in particullar is that, although the fitlers are all working and functional, unless the user has specific parameters in mind before they work through the filters it would be difficult to know exactly what to search for. 
- One solution would be to have drop down lists in each of the filters to show what was available to search in each parameter.
